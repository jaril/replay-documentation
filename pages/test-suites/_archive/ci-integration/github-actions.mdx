# Uploading recordings with GitHub Actions

The GitHub action `replayio/action-upload` makes it easy to upload recordings, but if you’d like more control you can also use the `@replayio/replay` CLI to upload replays. [See instructions here](/test-suites/cypress/continuous-integration/other-ci-providers).

### Upload replays

By default, the GitHub action will upload all failed recordings. 

```yaml
- name: Upload replays
  if: always()
  uses: replayio/action-upload@v0.5.1
  with:
    api-key: ${{ secrets.RECORD_REPLAY_API_KEY }}
```

### Upload all recordings

If you’d like to upload all recordings regardless of whether the test passed or failed, you can pass in a `filter` field

```yaml
- name: Upload Replay recordings
  if: always()
  uses: replayio/action-upload@v0.5.1
  with:
    api-key: <API Key>
    filter: ${{ 'function() { true }' }}
```

### Make recordings public

By default recordings will be private and only available to yourself or members of the workspace. If you’d like to make the recordings public so that anyone with the URL can open them, you can pass in the `public` field.

```yaml
- name: Upload Replay recordings
  if: always()
  uses: replayio/action-upload@v0.5.1
  with:
    api-key: <API Key>
    public: true
```
